# How does pandas deal with dates? 
1. Convert strings to datetime.<br/>
2. Assemble a datetime from multiple columns.<br/>
3. Get year, month and day.<br/>
4. Get the week of year, the day of week, and leap year.<br/>
5. Get the age from the date of birth.<br/>
6. Improve performance by setting date column as the index.<br/>
